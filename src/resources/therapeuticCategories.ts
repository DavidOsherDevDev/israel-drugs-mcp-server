      description: `Complete reference guide for the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system used in Israeli healthcare. Provides pharmaceutical decision support for drug categorization, therapeutic alternative identification, and evidence-based prescribing.

**Resource Content:**
- Complete catalog of 1,172+ ATC therapeutic codes from Israeli Ministry of Health
- Hierarchical organization from anatomical groups to specific chemical substances
- Therapeutic relationship mapping between drug classes and clinical applications
- Prescribing pattern analysis and clinical usage guidelines
- Evidence-based therapeutic substitution guidance

**Clinical Applications:**
- Drug class selection for specific therapeutic indications
- Generic and therapeutic alternative identification
- Formulary development and pharmaceutical policy
- Clinical pharmacist consultation support
- Medical education and pharmaceutical training

**ATC Classification Levels:**
- Level 1: Anatomical main groups (14 major body systems)
- Level 2: Therapeutic subgroups (organ/system specific)
- Level 3: Pharmacological subgroups (mechanism of action)
- Level 4: Chemical subgroups (therapeutic class) - PRIMARY CLINICAL LEVEL
- Level 5: Chemical substances (specific active ingredients)

This resource serves as the definitive pharmaceutical reference for therapeutic classification and drug selection within Israeli healthcare practice.`,
